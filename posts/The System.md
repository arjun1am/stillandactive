### "All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players" - Shakespeare. This quote has inspired me for ages, and now its time that I put this approach into practice. Can one detach from their ego, and simply level up their mind and body without concern for success, failure, desire, and passion? This is an experiment to try it out myself.
